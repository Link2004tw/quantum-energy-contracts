Development Setup Guide for EnergyContract
This guide provides a comprehensive setup for developing, testing, and deploying the EnergyContract smart contract using Hardhat with the @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox plugin and the Remix Solidity IDE with AI-powered security features. It also covers setting up a Next.js frontend in the solarfarm_ui directory with Firebase for authentication and Realtime Database. The guide includes IDE configuration, dependencies, local blockchain setup, testing environment, Firebase and Next.js setup, deployment process, professional QA process, and common troubleshooting issues to ensure developers can get productive quickly.
IDE Configuration
Recommended IDEs

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A lightweight, extensible IDE for Solidity, JavaScript, and TypeScript development, ideal for Hardhat, Next.js, and Firebase integration.
Remix Solidity IDE: A web-based IDE for Solidity development, offering AI-powered security analysis, static analysis, and easy contract compilation and deployment. Access at remix.ethereum.org.

VS Code Extensions
For developers using VS Code, install the following extensions:

Solidity by Juan Blanco (juanblanco.solidity): Provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and linting for Solidity.
Prettier (esbenp.prettier-vscode): Formats code for consistency (supports Solidity with a plugin).
ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Lints JavaScript/TypeScript files used in Hardhat scripts, tests, and Next.js.
Hardhat (nomicfoundation.hardhat-vscode): Integrates Hardhat tasks and debugging, leveraging hardhat-toolbox.
DotENV (mikestead.dotenv): Supports .env file syntax for environment variables.
Next.js (unvs.next-js): Optional, provides Next.js-specific snippets and support.

VS Code Settings
Add the following to your VS Code settings.json (accessed via File > Preferences > Settings or Ctrl+,):
{
  "solidity.compileUsingRemoteVersion": "v0.8.30",
  "solidity.defaultCompiler": "remote",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "prettier.requireConfig": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "[solidity]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "juanblanco.solidity"
  },
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[typescript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "files.associations": {
    "*.sol": "solidity"
  }
}


Ensures Solidity compiler version matches the contract (^0.8.30).
Enables auto-formatting with Prettier for Solidity, JavaScript, and TypeScript files.
Associates .sol files with Solidity.

Remix Setup and AI Features
Remix is a browser-based IDE that simplifies Solidity development and provides powerful security analysis tools. To set up Remix for EnergyContract:

Access Remix:
Open remix.ethereum.org in a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Create a new workspace or import files from your local project (e.g., contracts/EnergyContract.sol, contracts/MockV3Aggregator.sol, contracts/MaliciousContract.sol).


Configure Remix:
Solidity Compiler: In the "Solidity Compiler" plugin, select version 0.8.30 to match the contract's pragma solidity ^0.8.30.
Environment: Use "JavaScript VM" for quick testing or connect to a Hardhat node (http://127.0.0.1:8545) via "Injected Web3" or "Web3 Provider" for local blockchain testing.
File Explorer: Upload or create EnergyContract.sol, MockV3Aggregator.sol, and MaliciousContract.sol.


AI-Powered Security Analysis:
Remix Static Analysis: Activate the "Solidity Static Analysis" plugin to detect vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy in revealPurchase, withdrawRefunds, unchecked external calls).
AI Features: Use Remix's experimental AI-driven code analysis (via plugins like "Code Analysis" or third-party integrations) to:
Identify security threats (e.g., reentrancy, access control issues, arithmetic overflows).
Suggest gas optimizations for functions like calculateRequiredPayment.
Detect logical errors in the commit-reveal process.


Usage: Run AI analysis on EnergyContract.sol and review reports for warnings about reentrancy, access control, or price feed issues. Cross-reference with test/security/SecurityTests.test.js.
Limitations: AI features are experimental and may miss edge cases. Combine with static analysis and Hardhat tests for comprehensive coverage.


Testing in Remix:
Use the "Solidity Unit Testing" plugin to write and run simple tests, complementing Hardhat tests.
Deploy contracts to the JavaScript VM or Hardhat node to test interactions (e.g., authorizeParty, commitPurchase).

Project Setup
For Hardhat users, initialize a Hardhat project:
npx hardhat init

Choose "Create a JavaScript project" and select the option to include hardhat-toolbox. This sets up the project with the necessary plugins.
Create or update package.json with the following dependencies:
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox": "^5.0.0",
    "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^5.0.2",
    "@chainlink/contracts": "^0.8.0",
    "hardhat": "^2.22.10",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
    "chai": "^4.5.0"
  }
}

Run npm install to install dependencies. For Remix users, dependencies are not required as Remix handles compilation and deployment in-browser.
Local Blockchain Setup (Hardhat Configuration)
Hardhat Configuration File
For Hardhat users, create or update hardhat.config.js in the project root to leverage hardhat-toolbox:
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.30",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200
      }
    }
  },
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      chainId: 1337,
      gas: 12000000,
      blockGasLimit: 12000000,
      accounts: {
        count: 20,
        initialBalance: "10000000000000000000000" // 10,000 ETH
      }
    },
    sepolia: {
      url: process.env.SEPOLIA_RPC_URL || "https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY",
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
  }
};


Solidity Version: Matches ^0.8.30 for contract compatibility.
Optimizer: Enabled with 200 runs for gas-efficient bytecode.
Hardhat Network: Configured for local testing with generous gas limits and accounts.
Sepolia Network: Configured for testnet deployment (update with your RPC URL and private key).
Etherscan: For contract verification, enabled via hardhat-toolbox.
Hardhat Toolbox: Provides hardhat-ethers, hardhat-waffle, hardhat-chai-matchers, and hardhat-verify for testing and deployment.

Environment Variables
For Hardhat users, create a .env file in the project root:
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here


Replace YOUR_INFURA_KEY with your Infura project ID.
Replace your_private_key_here with your wallet's private key (never commit to version control).
Replace your_etherscan_api_key_here with your Etherscan API key.
Use a .gitignore to exclude .env:node_modules/
.env



Remix users can configure network settings directly in the IDE's "Deploy & Run Transactions" plugin.
Starting the Local Blockchain
For Hardhat users, run the Hardhat node:
npx hardhat node

This starts a local Ethereum blockchain at http://127.0.0.1:8545 with 20 accounts pre-funded with 10,000 ETH each. Remix users can connect to this node via the "Web3 Provider" environment or use the JavaScript VM for quick testing.
Firebase Setup
Firebase is used for the solarfarm_ui frontend to manage user authentication and store data in the Realtime Database. This section guides you through creating a Firebase project, enabling authentication and Realtime Database, and securely handling sensitive Firebase configuration files (e.g., service account credentials) to avoid exposing secrets, as previously encountered with solarfarmsystem-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-b3714a635d.json.
1. Install Firebase Dependencies
For the solarfarm_ui frontend, install the Firebase JavaScript SDK:
cd solarfarm_ui
npm install firebase@10.14.1


Version: firebase@10.14.1 (latest stable as of July 2025).
Add to solarfarm_ui/package.json:{
  "dependencies": {
    "firebase": "^10.14.1"
  }
}


Run npm install in the solarfarm_ui directory.

2. Create a Firebase Project

Go to Firebase Console:
Open console.firebase.google.com and sign in with your Google account.
Click Add project, name it (e.g., solarfarmsystem), and follow the prompts to create the project.
Disable Google Analytics if not needed for simplicity.


Get Firebase Configuration:
In the Firebase Console, go to Project settings > General.
Under "Your apps," click Web (</>) to register a web app.
Provide an app nickname (e.g., solarfarm-ui) and click Register app.
Copy the Firebase configuration object (e.g., firebaseConfig with apiKey, authDomain, etc.).


Add Configuration to Frontend:
Create a file solarfarm_ui/src/firebase-config.js:import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export default app;


Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase project’s configuration.
Security Note: Do not commit firebase-config.js to version control if it contains sensitive data. Instead, use environment variables (see below).



3. Enable Authentication

Enable Authentication in Firebase Console:
Go to Build > Authentication in the Firebase Console.
Click Get started, then enable desired sign-in providers (e.g., Email/Password, Google).
For Email/Password:
Enable Email/Password under Sign-in providers.
Optionally, enable Email link (passwordless sign-in) for a smoother user experience.


Save changes.


Integrate Authentication in Frontend:
Update solarfarm_ui/src/firebase-config.js to include authentication services:import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
export { app, auth };


Use the auth object in your frontend to handle user sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out (e.g., with signInWithEmailAndPassword, createUserWithEmailAndPassword, or signInWithPopup).



4. Enable Realtime Database

Enable Realtime Database in Firebase Console:
Go to Build > Realtime Database in the Firebase Console.
Click Create Database, select a location (e.g., us-central1), and start in test mode (allows read/write access for development; secure later).
Note the database URL (e.g., https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com) and add it to firebaseConfig.


Secure Database Rules:
In Realtime Database > Rules, update the default rules to secure access (e.g., require authentication):{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}


For development, keep test mode; for production, refine rules based on your app’s needs (e.g., restrict to specific paths).


Integrate Realtime Database in Frontend:
Update solarfarm_ui/src/firebase-config.js to include the Realtime Database:import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getDatabase } from "firebase/database";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
const database = getDatabase(app);
export { app, auth, database };


Use the database object to read/write data (e.g., with set, ref, onValue from firebase/database).



5. Securely Handle Firebase Service Account Credentials
The file solarfarm_ui/solarfarmsystem-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-b3714a635d.json (previously flagged by GitHub as a secret) contains sensitive Firebase Admin SDK credentials for server-side access. To securely handle it:

Download the Service Account Key:
In the Firebase Console, go to Project settings > Service accounts.
Click Generate new private key to download the JSON file (e.g., solarfarmsystem-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-b3714a635d.json).
Security Warning: Do not commit this file to Git.


Add to .gitignore:
Update .gitignore in the project root:node_modules/
.env
solarfarm_ui/*.json


This prevents the service account file from being tracked.


Use Environment Variables for Admin SDK:
Install the Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations (e.g., in a Node.js backend):npm install firebase-admin@12.5.0


Create a .env file in the project root or solarfarm_ui:FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/solarfarmsystem-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-b3714a635d.json


Initialize the Admin SDK in your backend (e.g., solarfarm_ui/server.js):const admin = require("firebase-admin");
require("dotenv").config();

const serviceAccount = require(process.env.FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS);
admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
  databaseURL: "https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com"
});

const db = admin.database();
const auth = admin.auth();
module.exports = { db, auth };


Alternatively, store individual fields (e.g., private_key, client_email) as environment variables to avoid loading the JSON file directly:FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com

const admin = require("firebase-admin");
require("dotenv").config();

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert({
    projectId: process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
    privateKey: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY.replace(/\\n/g, '\n'),
    clientEmail: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
  }),
  databaseURL: process.env.FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
});

const db = admin.database();
const auth = admin.auth();
module.exports = { db, auth };




Security Best Practices:
Store the service account key in a secure location (e.g., outside the repository or in a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager or Google Cloud Secret Manager).
Restrict the key’s permissions in the Firebase Console to specific services (e.g., Realtime Database, Authentication).
Rotate the key if exposed (regenerate in Project settings > Service accounts).
Use GitHub Secret Scanning to catch accidental commits: https://github.com/Link2004tw/quantum-energy-contracts/settings/security_analysis.



6. Secure Frontend Configuration
To avoid exposing the Firebase configuration (apiKey, etc.) in firebase-config.js:

Use environment variables in the frontend:
Install dotenv in solarfarm_ui:npm install dotenv@16.4.5


Create solarfarm_ui/.env:NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id


Update .gitignore:solarfarm_ui/.env


Update solarfarm_ui/src/firebase-config.js:import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getDatabase } from "firebase/database";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
const database = getDatabase(app);
export { app, auth, database };


Note: Next.js requires NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for environment variables exposed to the browser.


Build and Test:
Run the frontend locally (see Next.js Setup below for details).



7. Test Firebase Integration

Authentication Tests:
Test sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out flows using the Firebase Authentication SDK.
Verify authenticated users can access the Realtime Database based on security rules.


Realtime Database Tests:
Write test scripts to push sample data to the database and retrieve it.
Example (in solarfarm_ui/src/test-firebase.js):import { auth, database } from "./firebase-config";
import { ref, set, onValue } from "firebase/database";
import { signInWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";

async function testFirebase() {
  try {
    // Test authentication
    const userCredential = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, "test@example.com", "password123");
    console.log("User signed in:", userCredential.user.uid);

    // Test Realtime Database
    const testRef = ref(database, "test/data");
    await set(testRef, { message: "Hello, Firebase!" });
    onValue(testRef, (snapshot) => {
      console.log("Data:", snapshot.val());
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Firebase test error:", error);
  }
}

testFirebase();


Run tests with a test user account (create in Firebase Console > Authentication).


Security Tests:
Attempt unauthorized database access to verify security rules.
Test edge cases (e.g., invalid credentials, expired tokens).



8. Troubleshooting Firebase Issues

Issue: solarfarmsystem-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-b3714a635d.json committed to Git.
Solution: Remove the file from history using git filter-repo (as done previously):git filter-repo --path solarfarm_ui/solarfarmsystem-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-b3714a635d.json --invert-paths
git push origin main --force


Rotate the key in Firebase Console > Project settings > Service accounts.


Issue: "Invalid Firebase configuration" error.
Solution: Verify firebaseConfig values match the Firebase Console. Ensure environment variables are loaded correctly.


Issue: Authentication or database access denied.
Solution: Check Firebase security rules and ensure the user is authenticated. Update rules in Realtime Database > Rules.


Issue: Environment variables not loading in frontend.
Solution: Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix is used and the build tool supports .env files. Restart the development server after updating .env.



Next.js Setup for Frontend
Next.js is used to build the solarfarm_ui frontend, providing a modern React framework with server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, integrated with Firebase for authentication and Realtime Database. This section guides you through setting up a Next.js project in the solarfarm_ui directory, configuring it with Firebase, and ensuring secure handling of sensitive credentials.
1. Initialize a Next.js Project

Create Next.js App:
Navigate to the solarfarm_ui directory (or create it if it doesn’t exist):mkdir -p solarfarm_ui
cd solarfarm_ui
npx create-next-app@15.0.1 .


Version: next@15.0.1 (latest stable as of July 2025).
Choose the following options during setup:
TypeScript: Yes (recommended for type safety).
ESLint: Yes.
Tailwind CSS: Optional (recommended for styling).
src directory: Yes.
App Router: Yes (modern Next.js routing).
Customize default import alias: No (or as preferred).




Update solarfarm_ui/package.json:
Ensure the following dependencies are included:{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "15.0.1",
    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18",
    "firebase": "^10.14.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5",
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",
    "eslint": "^8",
    "eslint-config-next": "15.0.1",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5"
  }
}


Run npm install to install dependencies.



2. Configure Firebase in Next.js

Set Up Firebase Configuration:
Use the Firebase configuration from the Firebase Setup section, ensuring environment variables are used to avoid exposing sensitive data.
Update solarfarm_ui/src/firebase-config.ts (TypeScript version for consistency):import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getDatabase } from "firebase/database";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
const database = getDatabase(app);
export { app, auth, database };


Create solarfarm_ui/.env.local for environment variables:NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id


Update solarfarm_ui/.gitignore:.env.local
.env
*.json
node_modules/
.next/




Set Up Firebase Admin SDK for Server-Side (Optional):
If server-side operations (e.g., API routes) require Firebase Admin SDK, install it:cd solarfarm_ui
npm install firebase-admin@12.5.0


Create solarfarm_ui/src/lib/firebase-admin.ts:import admin from "firebase-admin";

if (!admin.apps.length) {
  admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert({
      projectId: process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
      privateKey: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY?.replace(/\\n/g, '\n'),
      clientEmail: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
    }),
    databaseURL: process.env.FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
  });
}

const db = admin.database();
const auth = admin.auth();
export { db, auth };


Update solarfarm_ui/.env.local with Admin SDK credentials:FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com


Security Note: Store the Admin SDK credentials securely and never commit them. Use a secrets manager for production.



3. Create a Basic Next.js Page with Firebase

Create a Login Page:
Create solarfarm_ui/src/app/login/page.tsx:"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { auth } from "@/src/firebase-config";
import { signInWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";

export default function LoginPage() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState("");

  const handleLogin = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
      alert("Login successful!");
    } catch (err: any) {
      setError(err.message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleLogin}>
        <input
          type="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Email"
          required
        />
        <input
          type="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Password"
          required
        />
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
      </form>
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}




Create a Data Page:
Create solarfarm_ui/src/app/data/page.tsx:"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { database } from "@/src/firebase-config";
import { ref, onValue } from "firebase/database";

export default function DataPage() {
  const [data, setData] = useState<any>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const dataRef = ref(database, "test/data");
    onValue(dataRef, (snapshot) => {
      setData(snapshot.val());
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Realtime Database Data</h1>
      {data ? <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre> : <p>Loading...</p>}
    </div>
  );
}




Update Main Page:
Update solarfarm_ui/src/app/page.tsx:import Link from "next/link";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Solar Farm UI</h1>
      <nav>
        <Link href="/login">Login</Link>
        <Link href="/data">View Data</Link>
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
}





4. Run and Test the Next.js App

Start the Development Server:
Run:cd solarfarm_ui
npm run dev


Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.


Test Firebase Integration:
Navigate to /login and test sign-in with a test user (create in Firebase Console > Authentication).
Navigate to /data and verify Realtime Database data is displayed.
Check console logs for errors and validate security rules.


Add Test Script:
Update solarfarm_ui/src/test-firebase.ts:import { auth, database } from "./firebase-config";
import { ref, set, onValue } from "firebase/database";
import { signInWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";

async function testFirebase() {
  try {
    // Test authentication
    const userCredential = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, "test@example.com", "password123");
    console.log("User signed in:", userCredential.user.uid);

    // Test Realtime Database
    const testRef = ref(database, "test/data");
    await set(testRef, { message: "Hello, Next.js + Firebase!" });
    onValue(testRef, (snapshot) => {
      console.log("Data:", snapshot.val());
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Firebase test error:", error);
  }
}

testFirebase();


Run tests manually or integrate with a testing framework (e.g., Jest).



5. Secure Next.js Configuration

Environment Variables: Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix is used for client-side variables. Use non-prefixed variables (e.g., FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY) for server-side API routes.
API Routes: For server-side Firebase Admin SDK operations, create API routes (e.g., solarfarm_ui/src/app/api/test/route.ts):import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { db } from "@/src/lib/firebase-admin";

export async function GET() {
  try {
    const ref = db.ref("test/data");
    const snapshot = await ref.once("value");
    return NextResponse.json(snapshot.val());
  } catch (error: any) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 });
  }
}


Security Note: Restrict API routes to authorized users using Firebase Authentication tokens.

6. Troubleshooting Next.js Issues

Issue: Environment variables not loading.
Solution: Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side variables. Restart the development server (npm run dev) after updating .env.local.


Issue: Firebase configuration errors.
Solution: Verify firebaseConfig matches Firebase Console settings. Check for typos in .env.local.


Issue: Server-side Admin SDK fails.
Solution: Ensure FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY and other credentials are correctly set in .env.local. Verify file paths or secrets manager integration.


Issue: Next.js app fails to build.
Solution: Run npm run build and check error messages. Ensure TypeScript types are correct and dependencies are installed.

contract MaliciousContract {
    address public immutable energyContract;

    constructor(address _energyContract) {
        energyContract = _energyContract;
    }

    function commitPurchase(bytes32 _commitmentHash) external payable {
        (bool success, ) = energyContract.call(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("commitPurchase(bytes32)", _commitmentHash)

        if (!success) {
            // Silently fail to avoid infinite loop
        }
    }
}



Writing Tests
The test suites use Mocha and Chai (via hardhat-toolbox) for assertions, with Hardhat for blockchain interactions. Remix users can use the "Solidity Unit Testing" plugin for simpler tests. Three Hardhat test suites are provided:

Unit Tests (test/unit/EnergyContract.test.js):
Tests individual functions: authorization management (authorizeParty, unAuthorizeParty), price calculations (calculateRequiredPayment, getLatestEthPrice), commit-reveal security (commitPurchase, revealPurchase), and pull-based payments (withdrawRefunds).
Covers edge cases: duplicate authorizations, invalid commitment hashes, price feed failures, and commitment cooldown.
Note: The provided test suite references a maxEthPriceUSD parameter in revealPurchase, which is not present in EnergyContract.sol. This suggests a potential contract update or test inconsistency.


Integration Tests (test/integration/FullFlow.test.js):
Tests the complete purchase flow: authorizeParty, requestAddEnergy, confirmAddEnergy, commitPurchase, revealPurchase.
Tests emergency pause scenarios using the Pausable modifier.


Security Tests (test/security/SecurityTests.test.js):
Tests reentrancy attacks using MaliciousContract.sol on revealPurchase and withdrawRefunds.
Tests unauthorized access to owner-only and authorized-party-only functions.
Tests price manipulation scenarios (invalid/stale prices, cached price fallback).



Running Tests
For Hardhat users, compile and run all tests using hardhat-toolbox:
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test

To run specific test suites:
npx hardhat test test/unit/EnergyContract.test.js
npx hardhat test test/integration/FullFlow.test.js
npx hardhat test test/security/SecurityTests.test.js

The hardhat-toolbox plugin provides hardhat-chai-matchers for advanced assertions (e.g., to.emit, to.be.revertedWithCustomError) and hardhat-network-helpers for time manipulation (evm_increaseTime, evm_mine).
For Remix users:

Use the "Solidity Unit Testing" plugin to write and run tests directly in Remix.
Deploy contracts to the JavaScript VM or connect to a Hardhat node (http://127.0.0.1:8545) for testing.
Run static analysis and AI-driven security checks on EnergyContract.sol to complement Hardhat tests.

Writing Additional Tests
Follow these best practices for Hardhat and Remix tests:

Use Helpers: Leverage helper functions (addEnergy, authorizeParty, getHashedCommitment, commitPurchase, revealPurchase, advanceTime) for consistent setup in Hardhat tests.
Fetch Constants: Retrieve constants (MAX_KWH_PER_PURCHASE, PRICE_PER_KWH_USD_CENTS, ADD_ENERGY_DELAY, COMMIT_REVEAL_WINDOW) from the contract to avoid hardcoding.
Test Edge Cases: Cover all custom errors (e.g., InvalidCommitmentHash, PriceFeedStale, MaxAuthorizedPartiesReached) and boundary conditions (e.g., zero inputs, maximum kWh).
Simulate Attacks: Use MaliciousContract.sol to test reentrancy or other attack vectors in Hardhat or Remix.
Verify Events: Check emitted events (Authorized, EnergyAdded, EnergyPurchased, etc.) for state-changing functions.
Manipulate Time: Use hardhat-network-helpers (evm_increaseTime, evm_mine) in Hardhat or Remix's JavaScript VM for time-dependent tests.
Security Analysis: In Remix, run "Solidity Static Analysis" and AI-driven analysis to detect vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, access control issues) before running Hardhat tests.

Deployment Process Step-by-Step
1. Compile Contracts
For Hardhat users:
npx hardhat compile

For Remix users, compile contracts in the "Solidity Compiler" plugin, ensuring version 0.8.30 is selected.
2. Create a Deployment Script (Hardhat)
Create scripts/deploy.js:
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying contracts with account:", deployer.address);

  // Deploy MockV3Aggregator for testing (skip for mainnet/testnet)
  const MockV3Aggregator = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("MockV3Aggregator");
  const priceFeed = await MockV3Aggregator.deploy(8, 2000 * 10 ** 8); // $2,000 ETH/USD
  await priceFeed.deployed();
  console.log("MockV3Aggregator deployed to:", priceFeed.address);

  // Deploy EnergyContract
  const EnergyContract = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("EnergyContract");
  const energyContract = await EnergyContract.deploy(priceFeed.address, deployer.address);
  await energyContract.deployed();
  console.log("EnergyContract deployed to:", energyContract.address);

  // Deploy MaliciousContract for security tests (optional)
  const MaliciousContract = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("MaliciousContract");
  const maliciousContract = await MaliciousContract.deploy(energyContract.address);
  await maliciousContract.deployed();
  console.log("MaliciousContract deployed to:", maliciousContract.address);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});

For Remix users, deploy contracts via the "Deploy & Run Transactions" plugin, selecting the JavaScript VM or Hardhat node.
3. Deploy to Local Blockchain
For Hardhat users, start the Hardhat node:
npx hardhat node

Deploy the contracts:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat

For Remix users, deploy to the JavaScript VM or connect to the Hardhat node (http://127.0.0.1:8545) via "Web3 Provider".
4. Deploy to Sepolia Testnet
For Hardhat users, update .env with your Sepolia RPC URL, private key, and Etherscan API key. Modify scripts/deploy.js to use the Sepolia Chainlink ETH/USD price feed address (e.g., 0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306). Deploy:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

For Remix users, select "Injected Web3" in the "Deploy & Run Transactions" plugin, connect to MetaMask with a Sepolia-funded account, and deploy with the correct price feed address.
5. Verify Contract on Etherscan
For Hardhat users, verify the contract using hardhat-verify (included in hardhat-toolbox):
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <PRICE_FEED_ADDRESS> <SOLAR_FARM_ADDRESS>

Replace <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>, <PRICE_FEED_ADDRESS>, and <SOLAR_FARM_ADDRESS> with the deployed addresses.
For Remix users, use the "Contract Verification" plugin to verify the contract on Etherscan, providing the same constructor arguments.
Professional QA Process
The QA process for EnergyContract is designed to ensure robustness, security, and reliability through comprehensive testing strategies. Below are answers to key testing strategy questions, addressing critical functions, potential attacks, price feed reliability, network congestion, and payment handling.
1. What's the most critical function to test first?
The most critical function to test first is revealPurchase(uint256 _kWh, uint256 _nonce). This function is central to the contract’s core functionality, as it:

Finalizes energy purchases by validating commitments (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_kWh, _nonce, msg.sender)) against commitmentHash).
Handles ETH payments (msg.value >= totalCostWei), deducts availableKWh, and transfers funds to paymentReceiver.
Interacts with the Chainlink price feed (getLatestEthPrice) and updates cachedEthPrice.
Uses nonReentrant to prevent reentrancy attacks and checks COMMIT_REVEAL_WINDOW for commitment validity.

Why it’s critical:

It processes financial transactions, making it a prime target for attacks (e.g., reentrancy, price manipulation).
It relies on external data (Chainlink price feed), introducing potential failure points (e.g., stale or invalid prices).
Errors in this function could lead to incorrect energy allocation, payment failures, or loss of funds.

Testing approach:

Unit Tests: Verify commitment validation, payment calculations (calculateRequiredPayment), and availableKWh updates. Test edge cases (e.g., zero _kWh, invalid _nonce, insufficient msg.value).
Security Tests: Use MaliciousContract.sol to attempt reentrancy attacks (e.g., via attackRevealPurchase). Test with invalid/stale Chainlink prices (PriceFeedStale, InvalidPriceBounds).
Integration Tests: Simulate the full flow (commitPurchase → revealPurchase) with valid and invalid inputs.
Remix Analysis: Run static analysis and AI-driven checks to detect logical errors or vulnerabilities in payment logic.

2. What attack would you try if you wanted to steal energy or ETH?
To steal energy or ETH, the most likely attack vector would be a reentrancy attack targeting the revealPurchase or withdrawRefunds functions, as both handle ETH transfers. The attack would involve:

Attack Vector: Deploy a malicious contract (like MaliciousContract.sol) that calls revealPurchase or withdrawRefunds and re-enters the contract via its receive function to repeatedly drain funds before state updates.
Example Attack:
An attacker commits a valid purchase (commitPurchase) with a correct commitmentHash.
In revealPurchase, the contract transfers ETH to paymentReceiver (potentially the attacker’s contract) before updating availableKWh or clearing purchaseCommitments.
The attacker’s receive function re-calls revealPurchase or withdrawRefunds, attempting to drain pendingRefunds or bypass energy deductions.


Mitigation in Contract: The nonReentrant modifier (from ReentrancyGuard) prevents reentrancy by locking the function during execution. The contract also uses a pull-based payment system (withdrawRefunds) to minimize direct ETH transfers.
Testing Strategy:
Deploy MaliciousContract.sol and simulate reentrancy via attackRevealPurchase and attackWithdrawRefunds in test/security/SecurityTests.test.js.
Verify that nonReentrant reverts reentrant calls with ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call.
Test edge cases: multiple rapid calls to withdrawRefunds, large overpayments to inflate pendingRefunds.
Use Remix’s static analysis to confirm reentrancy protection.



3. How do you ensure price feed reliability?
Price feed reliability is critical for accurate payment calculations in revealPurchase. The contract uses Chainlink’s AggregatorV3Interface with the following mechanisms to ensure reliability:

Chainlink Price Validation: The getLatestEthPrice function checks:
Price is positive (price > 0).
Data is not stale (updatedAt > block.timestamp - STALENESS_THRESHOLD).
Round is complete (answeredInRound >= roundId).
Price is within bounds (100 * 10^8 <= price <= 10000 * 10^8).


Cached Price Fallback: If Chainlink data is invalid, the contract uses cachedEthPrice (updated by getLatestEthPrice) unless it’s stale (block.timestamp > priceLastUpdated + STALENESS_THRESHOLD), reverting with PriceFeedStale.
Event Emission: PriceCacheUpdated logs price updates for transparency.

Testing Strategy:

Unit Tests: Test getLatestEthPrice with valid, stale, negative, and out-of-bounds prices using MockV3Aggregator.sol. Verify fallback to cachedEthPrice and PriceFeedStale reverts.
Integration Tests: Simulate Chainlink failures in revealPurchase and confirm correct use of cachedEthPrice.
Security Tests: Attempt price manipulation by updating MockV3Aggregator with invalid prices and verify InvalidPriceBounds reverts.
Remix Analysis: Use AI-driven analysis to check for price feed dependency issues. Run static analysis to detect unchecked external calls.
Monitoring: In production, monitor lastChainlinkFailure and PriceCacheUpdated events to detect price feed issues. Consider multi-oracle integration for enhanced reliability in future updates.

4. What happens during network congestion?
Network congestion (e.g., high gas prices, delayed transactions) can impact EnergyContract operations, particularly time-sensitive functions like confirmAddEnergy and revealPurchase. The contract’s design mitigates some risks:

Time-Sensitive Operations:
confirmAddEnergy: Requires ADD_ENERGY_DELAY (2 minutes) to elapse. Congestion may delay confirmation, but the delay ensures security without breaking functionality.
revealPurchase: Must be called within COMMIT_REVEAL_WINDOW (5 minutes). Congestion could cause commitments to expire, reverting with CommitmentExpired.


Gas Limits: External calls (e.g., ETH transfers to paymentReceiver) use MAX_GAS_FOR_CALL (5,000,000), reducing the risk of out-of-gas errors during congestion.
Pausable: The owner can pause the contract (pause) during extreme congestion to prevent failed transactions or unsafe operations.

Testing Strategy:

Simulate Congestion: Use Hardhat’s hardhat-network-helpers to increase block times (evm_increaseTime) and test CommitmentExpired and DelayNotElapsed reverts.
Gas Tests: Deploy on a testnet (e.g., Sepolia) with simulated high gas prices to verify MAX_GAS_FOR_CALL sufficiency. Test with low gas limits to trigger PaymentFailed.
Integration Tests: Test full flows under delayed conditions, ensuring state consistency (e.g., availableKWh, pendingRefunds).
Remix Testing: Use JavaScript VM to simulate delayed transactions by advancing block timestamps.
Mitigation: Document the need for users to set appropriate gas prices during congestion. Consider adding a clearExpiredCommitment test to handle expired commitments gracefully.

5. How do you handle partial payments or overpayments?
The EnergyContract handles partial payments and overpayments in revealPurchase as follows:

Partial Payments: If msg.value < totalCostWei (calculated via calculateRequiredPayment), the transaction reverts with PaymentAmountTooSmall. This ensures no energy is allocated without full payment.
Overpayments: If msg.value > totalCostWei, the excess ETH is stored in pendingRefunds[msg.sender]. Users can retrieve overpayments via withdrawRefunds, which is secured by nonReentrant and reverts with NoRefundsAvailable if no funds are available.
Security Measures:
The contract clears purchaseCommitments after a successful revealPurchase to prevent double-spending.
ETH transfers to paymentReceiver and refunds use MAX_GAS_FOR_CALL to mitigate out-of-gas risks.
The PriceCacheUpdated event logs price changes to ensure transparency in payment calculations.



Testing Strategy:

Unit Tests: Test revealPurchase with msg.value below, equal to, and above totalCostWei. Verify PaymentAmountTooSmall reverts and pendingRefunds updates for overpayments.
Security Tests: Use MaliciousContract.sol to attempt reentrancy on withdrawRefunds with large overpayments. Verify nonReentrant protection.
Integration Tests: Simulate a full purchase flow with overpayments, followed by withdrawRefunds, and check RefundWithdrawn events.
Remix Analysis: Run static analysis to verify safe ETH transfers and AI-driven checks for refund logic errors.
Edge Cases: Test zero msg.value, maximum msg.value, and multiple overpayment withdrawals to ensure state consistency.

Common Troubleshooting Issues
1. Compilation Errors

Issue: "Compiler version mismatch" or "Unknown pragma".
Solution: Ensure hardhat.config.js (Hardhat) or Remix's "Solidity Compiler" plugin specifies solidity: "0.8.30". Update package.json dependencies if mismatched.


Issue: Missing dependencies (e.g., @openzeppelin/contracts).
Solution: Run npm install for Hardhat. In Remix, ensure contract imports (e.g., OpenZeppelin) are accessible via npm or GitHub.



2. Test Failures

Issue: Tests fail due to invalid Chainlink price feed data.
Solution: Ensure MockV3Aggregator is deployed with valid parameters (e.g., 8 decimals, positive price). Update latestPrice or updatedAt in tests for staleness scenarios.


Issue: Gas limit exceeded in tests.
Solution: Increase blockGasLimit in hardhat.config.js or specify higher gasLimit in test transactions (e.g., revealPurchase). In Remix, adjust gas limits in the "Deploy & Run Transactions" plugin.


Issue: InvalidCommitment or CommitmentExpired errors.
Solution: Verify commitment hashes match (getHashedCommitment) and COMMIT_REVEAL_WINDOW has not expired. Use hardhat-network-helpers (evm_increaseTime) or Remix's JavaScript VM correctly.


Issue: Reentrancy tests fail unexpectedly.
Solution: Ensure MaliciousContract.sol is deployed and correctly interacts with EnergyContract. Check gas limits for attackRevealPurchase and attackWithdrawRefunds.



3. Deployment Issues

Issue: "Invalid RPC URL" or "Network error".
Solution: Verify SEPOLIA_RPC_URL in .env (Hardhat) or MetaMask settings (Remix). Test connectivity with curl <RPC_URL>.


Issue: "Insufficient funds" error.
Solution: Fund the deployer account with ETH on Sepolia using a faucet (e.g., Infura Sepolia Faucet).


Issue: "Contract verification failed".
Solution: Confirm ETHERSCAN_API_KEY is correct (Hardhat) or entered correctly in Remix's "Contract Verification" plugin. Ensure constructor arguments match the deployment script.



4. Runtime Errors

Issue: PriceFeedStale or InvalidEthPrice during revealPurchase.
Solution: Update MockV3Aggregator with a valid price and recent updatedAt. Ensure the cache is initialized via getLatestEthPrice. In Remix, test price feed interactions in the JavaScript VM.


Issue: PaymentFailed during revealPurchase or withdrawRefunds.
Solution: Verify paymentReceiver is a valid EOA (checked in updatePaymentReceiver). Check MAX_GAS_FOR_CALL is sufficient in the contract.


Issue: Tests fail due to mismatched constants.
Solution: Fetch constants (MAX_KWH_PER_PURCHASE, PRICE_PER_KWH_USD_CENTS) from the contract instead of hardcoding.



5. Environment Issues

Issue: .env file not loading (Hardhat or Next.js).
Solution: Ensure dotenv is installed and require("dotenv").config() is in hardhat.config.js or properly configured in Next.js. Check .env file permissions.


Issue: Node.js version conflicts (Hardhat or Next.js).
Solution: Use nvm to switch to Node.js v18.x (nvm install 18 && nvm use 18).


Issue: Remix AI analysis fails to detect issues.
Solution: Ensure the latest Remix version is used. Run "Solidity Static Analysis" alongside AI features for comprehensive checks. Cross-reference with Hardhat security tests.



6. Remix-Specific Issues

Issue: Remix fails to connect to Hardhat node.
Solution: Ensure the Hardhat node is running (npx hardhat node) and Remix is set to "Web3 Provider" with the correct URL (http://127.0.0.1:8545).


Issue: AI features unavailable or outdated.
Solution: Check for Remix plugin updates or use an alternative browser. Fall back to static analysis or Hardhat security tests if AI features are unstable.
